**Here, I described what each script does:** \n
0. Script that prints "Hello, World", followed by a new line to the standard output.
1. Script that displays a confused smiley
2. Script to display the content of the /etc/passwd file
3. Display the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts
4. Display the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd
5. Display the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd
6. Displays the third line of the file iacta (sed not allowed)
7. Script that creates a file named exactly as shown in 7-file
8. Script that writes into a file the result of another command. Overwrites whatever is in the file. Create the file if it doesn't exist.
9. Script that duplicates the last line of the file iacta. The file iacta will be in the working directory.
10. Script that deletes all the regular files (not the directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all it subfolders.
11. Script that counts the number of directories and sub-directories in the current directory. (count hidden directories. Don't count current and parent directories).
12. Displays the 10 newest files in the current directory (one file per line. Sorted from the newest to the oldest)
13. Takes a list of words as input and prints only words that appear exactly once.
14. Display lines containing the pattern "root" from the file /etc/passwd
