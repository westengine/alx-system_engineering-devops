1. Script that displays a confused smiley
2. Script to display the content of the /etc/passwd file
3. Display the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts
4. Display the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd
5. Display the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd
6. Displays the third line of the file iacta (sed not allowed)
